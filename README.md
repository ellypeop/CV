# CV
My curriculum vitae written in LaTeX. [Tutorial](https://medium.com/@jasonzhang02/automating-resumes-with-overleaf-github-and-github-actions-4f131a333939) to create the script found in /workflows. Adjustments were made to update the versions and timezone and upload the CV PDF to the directory. PDF is converted to PNG to embed in README; multiple PNG files were generated and combined via script.
